This is a simple date-format converter written in pure PHP.
I have used this piece of code in my projects, that required a date in swedish.

This takes the format of (dd mm yy hh:mm:ss) and converts to either (in swedish) 26 January 2021, 
Today 21:38 (9:38 PM) or Yesterday 21:38 (9:38 PM) depending on when the query was executed i.e when
the date was saved.
